# Computational Quantum Dynamics

We are taking a lecture on numerical methods in quantum mechanics at Heidelberg University held by Dr. Martin GÃ¤rttner.
This repository contains the exercise sheets we have to solve every week and a final project (coming soon..). 
Additional information about this lecture can be found [here](https://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/user/marting/teaching/ws1819_qnum).
