# Computational Quantum Dynamics

This is a collection of programming exercises for a lecture on numerical methods in quantum mechanics held by Dr. Martin GÃ¤rttner during the winter term 2018/2019 at Heidelberg University.
Additionally we had to conduct an extensive project on "The Gross-Pitaevskii equation - Dynamics of solitons and vortices" at the end of the semester. 

All exercises have been solved by [(@carlvr)](https://github.com/carlvr) and myself.
